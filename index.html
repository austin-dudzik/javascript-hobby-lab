                <h3>Introduction</h3>

                <p>For about 4 years, I've had a good amount of self-taught programming experience and have always had a passion for it since when I first learned about it. In my free time, I like to work on frontend and backend development and I've released a few projects over the years. I have a good amount of knowledge with HTML, CSS, PHP, and a bit of MySQL. I'm hoping that the JavaScript class will help me learn more about JavaScript and its functions, since I'm not as strong in that area, besides the experience I have using jQuery.</p>
